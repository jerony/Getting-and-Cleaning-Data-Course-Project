As explanation of the summary statistics listed in the "features" file provided by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto and 
Davide Anguita in their "features info" and "README" text, each window produced 128 readings on the sensor signals. Each window then 
produced the 151 summary statistics described in the "features info" file. Each subject/activity combination has many windows associated 
with it. The goal of this project was to condense each of these combinations into one record, where each record has the average summary
statistic of that combination. There are 17 signals that we needed to summarize with the statistical measures listed in the "features info" 
file. Of those 17, 8 spanned across three dimensions, so there are 33 signals that need to be summarized. Since we only care about the mean
and standard deviation measurements for this project, we must have 66, (33 X 2), variables in our final data set, (excluding the variables 
identifying the activity and subject). So, for example, subject 1 has 51 windows associated with the "Sitting" reading; each window produces
its' own set of summary statistics, so there are 51 values describing the average of the fbodyAcc Magnitude variable, (one for each window).
Those 51 windows are condensed into one vector, where each element in the vector represents the average summary statistic across each 
window associated with that paritcular combination. Since this produces one row for each subject/activity combination, (and since there are 
30 participants and 6 activities), the dimmensions of the final table is 180 X 68. The units of these average summary statistics are of
course identical the units of the original variables spelled out in the "features info" file.
